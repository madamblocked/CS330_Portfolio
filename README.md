# CS330_Portfolio

Some of the first key things I did was understand what concepts were being utilized in the 3D environment. This could include things such as knowing how many VBO/VAO sets to initialize, how many textures you want, etc. These are all things that I ended up writing down in different spaces on a piece of paper. After writing so much code on a computer and staring at a screen for hours, it becomes difficult to differentiate certain portions of code, especially when we are also expected to incorporate elements of polymorphism into our software design approach. To make a choice to change up the medium requires your brain to process the information in a different persepctive, and the user may catch onto things he/she could not see before writing.

This class helped me implement the concepts of repeated iterations when developing a program. There were many, many times where I simply changed a single value and reran my whole project. I noticed that even a single variable change, such as the stride between vertex points, can create an enitrely different shape from a cube/rectangular prism to a mess of triangles point every which way.

Ultimately, these skills will help me remain calm and focused in my career as a software dev. Thanks for reading!
